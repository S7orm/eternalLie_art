        <h2>Help! I have no idea what's going on!</h2>
        <p>The game will run afk and tabbed but offline progress would change the game too much. Leaving it too long could result in Rhan devouring the entire cult.</p>
        <p>The game is designed for PC and a longer monitor. It should run fine on tablets turned to the side but mobile screens are too small and would require an entire new UI.</p>
        <p>Warning! Spoilers! Don't read further than you must. In a nutshell, Dr. West -no relation- is in possession of an ancient manuscript. He can learn many things from this Tome and others he finds including how to control others, using them for his own gain. Building the cult is but a stepping stone on his way to greatness and he must be willing to sacrifice them, in whole or in part to find true power.</p>
        <p>West's basic Actions require different inputs such as pointerdown, press and hold as well as hover. Hover might require a pointerdown to get going onload and unlock. (web safety issue)</p>
        <p> West must keep his health up and his madness down but this isn't a souls game or anything. While it may be possible to fail, it is unlikely.</p> 
        <p>Health will stabilize toward West's current maximum over time in both directions.</p>
        <p>There are Minimum Madness and Terror requirements. This is not a cost and is not deducted. </p>

        <p>The old Gods are not your friends. Everything comes at a cost. Deals made are permanent.</p>
        <p>Shards are provided on resets for the members of the cult in varying amounts. Does not include innocents or insane.</p>
        <p>Permanent Madness will build up. Each reset increases it.</p>
